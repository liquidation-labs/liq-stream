# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

### ðŸ“Œ Changelog entry

## v0.6.0 (2025-09-27)
### Added
- **Aster adapter** (USDT-M only) with normalized liquidation stream.
- **Hyperliquid adapter** (USDC): tails local node `fills_streaming` logs and normalizes liquidation fills.
- `--all` now includes `aster:usdt` and `hyperliquid:usdc`.
- Simple terminal dashboards:
  - `liq_simple.sh` + `liq_simple.awk` â€” counts by exchange (windowed or all-time).
  - `hyperliquid_6h.sh` + `hyperliquid_6h.awk` â€” last 6h activity (ASCII-safe).
### Changed
- `adapters/__init__.py`: wired `AsterAdapter` and `HyperliquidAdapter` into `get_adapter`.
- `stream.py`: constructor compatibility (Aster), USDC market handling (Hyperliquid), and `--all` set updated.
- README: documented Aster + Hyperliquid, added troubleshooting.
### Notes
- **Schema unchanged** (still `exchange, market, symbol, side, qty, price, notional, ts_exch_ms, ts_ingest_ms, raw`).
- New markets: `market` can now be `usdc` (Hyperliquid).
